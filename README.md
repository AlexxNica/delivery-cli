# Delivery CLI

The CLI for Chef Delivery. Written in Rust, super experimental, will probably hurt your kittens.

## Build me

```bash
cargo build
```

## Test me

```bash
cargo test
```

## Develop me

Hack about, then:

```bash
cargo run -- review ...
```

Where "review" and friends are the arguments you would pass to the delivery cli.

Whee... This is awesome.

Showing some awesome sauce for the Gap
